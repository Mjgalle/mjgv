      <h2>Front End Web Developer</h2>
      <p class="quickIntro">I decided to become a FEWD when I realized that my Graphic Design portfolio was not strong, and I had no internship experience. Right before I graduated college, I applied to the Disney College Program and got accepted.
        <br><br>
      I quickly realized that although it was a great place to work in, it was just not for me. I moved back in with my parents and after repeatedly seeing positions open for Front End Developers, I decided I had to learn these skills so I could start my career. 
        <br><br>
      After applying to BrainStation I was accepted into their Fall 2017 Cohort, shortly after finishing it and starting my job search, I landed my first job.
